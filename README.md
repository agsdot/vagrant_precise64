Goal of project:

Well folks, here's to my first Vagrantfile setup for provisioning a Vagrant box.  Yah, it's a plain jane Ubuntu box, not something more fancy, but it's a start.  

The goal is to provision and set it up with rvm / ruby , node javascript, python / virtualenv and gvm as in groovy.  Also lets add in some flair of rails as well as express.  We'll see if and how it can be done.  

First things first, following a tutorial for how to provision with shell script and setting up an apache instance.
